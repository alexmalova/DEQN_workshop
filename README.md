# Deep Equilibrium Nets for Solving Dynamic Stochastic Models (September 03 – 04, 2024)

This is a 2-day Ph.D. workshop on the application of deep neural networks as a global solution method, held at the MCC during the summer break of 2024 (03.09-
04.09.2024)


## Course Objectives:

* The objective of the course is to gain practical familiarity with cutting-edge deep learning-aided approaches to solving dynamic optimization problems.

* We will study:
  - Basics in neural networks and deep learning
  - Deep Equilibrium Nets (DEQN) as a global solution method

* The lectures will be interactive, in a workshop-like style, that is, a mix of theory and actively playing with code examples (delivered in Python and deployed on a cloud computing infrastructure).


## Class enrollment on the [Nuvolos Cloud](https://nuvolos.cloud/)

* All lecture materials (slides, codes, and further readings) will be distributed via the [Nuvolos Cloud](https://nuvolos.cloud/).

## Prerequisites

* Basic econometrics.
* Basic programming in Python (see [this link to QuantEcon](https://python-programming.quantecon.org/intro.html) for a thorough introduction).
* A brief Python refresher is provided [under this link](python_refresher).
* A brief Python on Jupyter Notebooks is provided [under this link](python_refresher/jupyter_intro.ipynb) 
* Basic calculus and probability (The book [Mathematics for Machine learning](https://mml-book.github.io/) provides a good overview of skills participants are required to be fluent in).

### Teaching Philosophy
Lectures will be interactive, in a workshop-like style,
using [Python](http://www.python.org), [scikit learn](https://scikit-learn.org/), [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) on [Nuvolos](http://nuvolos.cloud),
a browser-based cloud infrastructure in which files, datasets, code, and applications work together,
in order to directly implement and experiment with the introduced methods and algorithms.
